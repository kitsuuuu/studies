## Studies

  These are a few programs I make while studying.
  
  Feel free to use them as a study method or edit and use them as you wish.
  
  If you have any questions about my codes send me a message! I'm more than happy to help you!
  
  Also, if you think I'm capable of joining your team of initiate programmers contact me! I'm interested in joining a team of coders.
  
  I'm also going to make some repositories for my Youtube videos where I try to teach my viewers how to code.
  
  Also, I will be creating some repositories for me and my friends where we will publish our projects.
  
  This repository will mostly have programs coded in Python | Java | Javascript & Node.js | C | C# | C++ | Web Languages
